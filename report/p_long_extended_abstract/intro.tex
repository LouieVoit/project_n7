This project, named MATRIX~\cite{matrix} but officialy named "On-set 3D Reconstruction Tool", aims at developing a tool to do a 3D reconstruction of a scene from pictures of this scene. The 
reconstruction is based on an already existing library called openMVG~\cite{openMVG} that people are already using for the 
real time previzualisation of special effects during the shooting of a movie. What we did was building a graphical user
interface around this library using different languages as Qt~\cite{qt}, QML, PyQt, Python, C++ so that user can automatize 
the whole reconstruction process. While reading this abstract, you have to keep in mind that this project wasn't
about ending up with something really stable and usable, but more about building some sort of a prototype that 
people could use to rebuild a real software. Indeed, what we did is now almost usable, the user can launch
a 3D reconstruction and import pictures from his computer or his camera, but more important, we have build a 
solid architecture and a re-usable code and that what the project was all about.
